### Choose your style

Select the default style for your theme by adding `style` to your config file:

```yaml
style: sidebar # One of "stacked", "sidebar", "topbar"
```

You can also set the style of a particular page by adding `style` to your frontmatter.

```yaml
---
style: sidebar # One of "stacked", "sidebar", "topbar"
---
```

#### [Sidebar](/home-sidebar.md)

![Stacked image](/assets/img/stacked-preview.png)

#### [Topbar](/home-topbar.md)

![Topbar image](/assets/img/topbar-preview.png)

### Links

In the `links` section, you can add links to showcase various pages on the web or your website.

![Links](/assets/img/links.png){: .border}

```yaml
links:
  - name: Example full entry
    web_url: https://www.example.com
    image_url: /assets/img/icon-topbar.png
    description: Example description
  - name: Example entry with url and image
    web_url: https://www.example.com
    image_url: /assets/img/icon-sidebar.png
  - name: Example entry with image
    image_url: /assets/img/icon-stacked.png
  - name: Example entry with description
    description: Example Description
  - name: Example entry with only a name
```

### Repositories

The `repositories` section allows you to display your GitHub repositories on your page.  You can sort them by stars or latest pushes, set a limit to the number of repositories displayed, and exclude archived, forked, or specific repositories from the list

![Repositories](/assets/img/repositories.png){: .border}

```yaml
repositories:
  sort_by: stars
  # sort_by options:
  #   - pushed
  #   - stars
  limit: 24
  exclude:
    archived: true
    forks: true
    repositories:
      # - respositories to exclude
```

### Social media

Utilize the `social_media` section to add links to your various social media profiles.  For each platform simply provide your username or user ID to have the corresponding icon and link appear on your profile.

![Social Media](/assets/img/social-media.png){: .border}

```yaml
social_media:
  behance: your_username
  dribbble: your_username
  docker: your_username
  facebook: your_username
  hackerrank: your_username
  instagram: your_username
  keybase: your_username
  linkedin: your_username
  mastodon: your_username
  medium: your_username
  stackoverflow: your_user_id
  telegram: your_username
  twitter: your_username
  unsplash: your_username
  vk: your_username
  vscode: your_username
  youtube: your_username
```

### Blog

Make entries for the blog the same way you normally would by placing entries in the `_posts` folder.  You can adjust the number of entries that show up in the main page by adjusting `posts_limit` in the `_config.yml` file.  If you have more posts than the limit, a `Read more` button will link to the paginated blog post page /blog/index.html.

![Blog](/assets/img/blog.png){: .border}

```yaml
posts_limit: 3
```

Additionally, the theme provides a paginate layout you can use.  By default, the theme serves pagination from `/assets/blog/index.html`.

But you can adjust the source by updating the config

```yaml
paginate: 6
paginate_path: "/assets/blog/page:num"
```

And adding a `index.html` page at the `pagenate_path`

```yaml
---
layout: paginate
title: My Blog
---
```
