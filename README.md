This theme is based on GitHub's primer style. It supports both light and dark modes, and four style options: appbar, sidebar, topbar, and stacked. Setting up is a breeze, as it automatically populates your profile using your GitHub user info. Add custom links like Linktree and share engaging blog posts effortlessly.
