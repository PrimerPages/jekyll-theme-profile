Thank you for considering contributing to `jekyll-theme-profile` â€“ your involvement is invaluable to our thriving community! This contributing page will guide you through the process of making meaningful contributions to our Jekyll theme.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have a conducive development environment by installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/). This will ensure that you have the necessary development environment in place.

Next, clone the project repository to your local machine and open it with vscode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/jekyll-theme-profile.git
cd jekyll-theme-profile
code .
```

And then [develop with vscode and docker](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/docker-development.html#how-to-set-up-vs-code-with-docker)


This theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site. To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to this theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` that are tracked with Git will be bundled.
