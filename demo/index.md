# Welcome to jekyll-theme-profile theme!

This theme is based on GitHub's primer style. It supports both light and dark modes, and four style options: 

- [appbar](appbar.md)
- [sidebar](sidebar.md)
- [topbar](topbar.md)
- [stacked](stacked.md)

Setting up is a breeze, as it automatically populates your profile using your GitHub user info. Add custom links like Linktree and share engaging blog posts effortlessly.
