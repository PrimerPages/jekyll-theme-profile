The timeline feature is a sleek, chronological display of your content. It's designed to present your posts, updates, or any time-based information in an easy-to-read, visually appealing format. With customizable options and responsive design, it's a powerful addition to this theme.

## Setting Up Your Timeline

Implementing the timeline is as easy as adding a single line to your Jekyll template:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-timeline.html collection=site.posts limit=5 %}
```
{% endraw %}

## Use Case 1: Company News and Updates

For businesses, the timeline can serve as a dynamic news feed:

- **Share company milestones**: Highlight key achievements, new partnerships, or important announcements.
- **Showcase growth**: Present your company's journey in a visual, chronological format.
- **Engage stakeholders**: Keep investors, employees, and customers informed about your latest developments.

Example:
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-timeline.html collection=site.news %}
```
{% endraw %}

## Use Case 2: Changelogs

For software developers or product managers, the timeline is perfect for displaying changelogs. It allows you to:

- **Organize updates chronologically**: Present your software updates, bug fixes, and new features in a clear, date-based format.
- **Highlight major releases**: Use the `post-timeline-card.html` to style major releases differently, making them stand out.
- **Provide a historical view**: Users can easily track the evolution of your product over time.

Example:
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-timeline.html collection=site.changelogs limit=20 %}
```
{% endraw %}

## Use Case 3: Portfolio Timeline

For creatives and professionals, the timeline can be adapted to showcase your work:

- **Display projects chronologically**: Show the evolution of your skills and style over time.
- **Highlight key works**: Use the limit parameter to feature your most significant or recent projects.
- **Tell your professional story**: Each entry can include details about the project, skills used, or outcomes achieved.

Example:
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-timeline.html collection=site.portfolio limit=12 %}
```
{% endraw %}
