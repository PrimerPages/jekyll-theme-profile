I'm excited to introduce a new feature that allows you to set custom background images for your posts. This feature gives you more creative control over the look and feel of your content, making it easier to align your post’s visuals with your message.

## Why Use Custom Backgrounds?

Custom backgrounds can:

- **Enhance visual appeal** – Make your posts stand out with eye-catching imagery.
- **Set the mood** – Use imagery to reflect the tone of your content.
- **Support your brand** – Maintain a consistent visual identity across your posts.

## How It Works

Adding a custom background is easy. Simply include a `background.image` field in your post’s front matter, like this:

```yaml
background:
  image: https://example.com/your-background-image.jpg
```

You can also fine-tune the styling using the `css_style` field, allowing you to adjust the appearance as needed.

## See It in Action
